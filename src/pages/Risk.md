> **Inadequate capital** is one of the major risk factor for a new venture because it is hard to assume estimate for daily cash flow. As we are new in market, we have uncertain daily income and it is difficult to manage monthly costs for business.
To decrease this type of risk, plan at least more than 8 months of funding budget to cover fixed monthly expenses such as, all kind of bills, staff salary, raw material for food. This will help if we are unable to make profit for 3-4 months.

> **Reputation management** is another risk factor for a start-up venture, because we have to deal with many competitors in market. Food quality, Food safety bad reviews, waiting time, price and employee's behavior can be important factor to deal with.
To avoid this always maintain food quality and taste, customer's concern should be top most priority, try to serve as fast as you can, menu price should be reasonable and train employees to talk politely  with each and every customer, ensure all employees have to follow all food safety procedures never serve expired food and make sure to track the temperature of food storage.  

> **Injuries and Liabilities** are another risk factor for a business. If someone get injured in cafe, we might face liability claims - to avoid this wet floor signs are important factor. While making food wearing gloves are also important, for staff non-slip shoes should be compulsory.
