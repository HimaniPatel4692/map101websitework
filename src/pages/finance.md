> Financial Plan 
> Inspirational Grounds is basing projected sales on the market research, industry analysis and proximity of other coffee houses in the area. We are looking to obtain a modest .1% of the market share.
> 
> The cost of goods sold is based on the price list of Espresso Services, Inc., and is consistent with costs in the coffee and espresso industry. The cost of the bakery items and candies is 50% of the selling price.
> 
> Inspirational Grounds will use its POS System to keep cash flow and sales goals on track, and to indicate which marketing efforts are worth the investment. We expect sales to easily exceed the break-even point from the first month onward. The following sections outline our projected Profit and loss, Cash Flow, and Balance Sheet.
