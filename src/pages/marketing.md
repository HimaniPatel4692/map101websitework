> As we are new in business, marketing plays a key role to attract customers in our cafe. For marketing plan, our estimated budget is 17% of our net profit. We are assuming 80,000/- to 85,000/- profit per month, so our marketing budget is around 15,000/- per month.
> 
> We are in digital world where social media and internet is everywhere, so digital marketing is our top most priority. For Google ads and Facebook ads we will spend 6000/- for both. In our research we observe that food porn is also the important thing for advertisement, so we found instagram and facebook as a strong platform to promote our cafe with attractive visual content and having delicious looking food photos on our page.  
> 
> After that to promote our cafe we will plan to print some pamphlets for door to door advertising with newspapers in morning. For this our total budget is 4000/- including printing and distributing. It will help us as we are new in market so people can know about our cafe. This pamphlets can also help us to promote our USPs in local market.
